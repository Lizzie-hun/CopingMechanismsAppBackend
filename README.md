# Overview

This software is the backend for an app to store coping mechanisms. It would be used as a reminder of good coping mechanisms. It currently has the ability to add and edit coping mechanisms and view the instructions for it. I am hoping to add the ability to sort them in different categories like difficulty, duration, and favorited items. 

This is an important app to me because I think it would be helpful for people like me. It can be used on hard days to cope and remind of coping mechanism that work best for you. I think it would be helpful to a lot of people if I could add some different features like timers and make the front end easy to use.
